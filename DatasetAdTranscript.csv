"Nutriforte is an innovative liquid mineral blend for drinking-water, offering readily available minerals and ease of use.Unlike solid minerals in dry feed, Nutriforte ensures that each individual cow gets the optimal level of minerals tailored to its daily needs.Nutriforte is easy to administer, has a homogeneous distribution and promotes the health and long(j)evity of your cows.It's commonly known that milk production is directly related to water intake. Since highly productive cows have a higher mineral requirement and a higher water intake, providing minerals through their water intake will give each cow the right amount of minerals.Did you know that about 60% of water by-passes the rumen? Minerals are readily available for absorption in the intestines and liquid minerals have a superior bio-availability compared to dry feed minerals.Mineral intake via water is not related to dry matter intake. So, in case of stress, illness or hot weather, your cows will get their necessary minerals.Also, water troughs(trofs) remain clean and you don't face algae growth.Nutriforte is easily administered to the water via an automated dosing system, controlled by a computer. Once installed you only have to insert herd size and daily mineral dose rates.A water meter will measure how many grams of minerals need to be injected per liter of water and will adjust the dose rate automatically based on fluctuations in daily water consumption.This ensures that each cow will get the minimum required dose of minerals, preventing mineral deficiencies.Once set, the accuracy of the computer prevents mistakes due to ""the human factor"", ensuring homogenous mixing during the day and preventing loss or waste due to surplus feed or dust.NUTRIFORTEEasy to administerHomogeneous distributionPromotes health and longevityNUTRIFORTELiquid minerals for healthy cows",1

"Why I Wrote HookedFor an entrepreneur, there is always one nagging question that has to be answered every single day: What should we build next? As the CEO of two tech companies, this question awaited me as soon as I opened my laptop in the morning and was still on my mind when I turned out the lights before bed each night.""What do we build next?"" is such an important question because the answer determines whom you hire, how much you spend, and, most importantly, whether your company will succeed or fail. The building pahse is where your blood, sweat, and tears (not to mention money) all go. But how do we decide what to build? What determines which projects we should invest in improving versus which ones we should ignore?For most of the history of product development, employees built whatever the boss wanted them to build. The leader of the company sent down orders from on high and teams got to work turning that vision into reality. Sometimes, the executive was right and the innovation would be successful, but most often those at the top were wrong. Product teams would spend months if not years (typically isolated from customers) building products that no one ultimately wanted. The lack of user input led to countless product failures.More recently, a new philosophy of innovation has changed the way many companies do business. Entrepreneurs-turned-authors such as Steve Blank and Eric Ries have promoted building products through continuous improvements by constantly testing and validating ideas with customers. By listening to customer feedback, they argue, companies can decrease the odds of building something no one really wants. I am a subscriber and advocate of Blank and Ries' process of ""customer development."" However, I found something missing when I implemented their methodology-the answer to that same nagging question regarding what to build.",1

"Dr. Ben Carson has been well-known for years as a world-class surgeon, serving at Johns Hopkins Hospital as head of pediatric neurosurgery. On February 7, 2013 he became known for the first time as a rising star in conservative politics. That was the day when he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, eloquently expressing his conservative ideals as President Barack Obama watched from only feet away.Since his groundbreaking speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, Dr. Carson has continued to rise in popularity among conservatives and many have speculated about whether he will run for President.In his CPAC speech on March 16, 2013, Carson discussed the hypothetical situation in which voters ""magically put me in the White House."" He also announced that he will retire from his medical career at the end of 2013, explaining that, ""I want to quit while I'm at the top of my game, and there are so many more things that could be done."" His retirement obviously would free him up to pursue political office.Days later, he told the New York Times that he would consider public service under the right circumstances: ""[I]f a year-and-a-half went by and there was no one on the scene and people are still clamoring, I would have to take [running for President] into consideration...""There appears to be a real chance that Ben Carson will run for President.

"When dining formally, in order to avoid an embarrassing utensil faux pas, observe the following protocol: Begin by locating your seafood fork.
